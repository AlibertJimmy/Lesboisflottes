Very neat decor, tastefully made. Very comfortable bedding. Shaded and pleasant outdoor terrace. It's hard to leave Julie's place because these few days have been idyllic. A great meetup.",

The welcome is extremely warm and the hosts are very available if you need anything else. The pretty beach of La Verne is a few minutes' walk away. Also to be tested: the restaurant La Paillote, with your feet in the water. Only one regret not being able to stay there longer!",

Julie and her husband gave us restaurant tips and especially made us feel comfortable thanks to their smiles! Only regret: we only stayed one night;)",

We appreciated the proximity (3 min) with the first beach, we read on the shaded terrace, very stylish, a real plus. Julie and her husband José Manuel, very nice and caring, recommended a great spot to dine and watch the sunset. We will be back in September for sure! Recommended',

The comfortable room is tastefully decorated and the use of the garden is a real plus. You can count on the tranquility offered by the hosts and benefit from their cordiality if you wish. I would highly recommend this listing.',

Recently renovated, well air-conditioned, naturally air-conditioned with 2 shaded terraces. Very quiet place. Not to be missed for a pleasant sejpur. To be done again.",

Julie always answers super fast and was really helpful and kind. <br/>We had a great stay! :)',

      comments: "We spent a week of our vacation in France and Julie and José Manuel were great hosts! The apartment is furnished with a lot of love for detail, newly renovated and super clean. The accommodation is equipped with everything you need: a very comfortable bed, a new bathroom, a new kitchen with cooking facilities, fridge, various cooking utensils and a Dolce Gusto coffee machine. The terrace right in front of the apartment is ideal for breakfast or dinner. And best of all: The rooms are always nice and cool even in high summer, and all without air conditioning. The beach can be reached on foot in 5 minutes. We also got many tips from Julie and José Manuel for excursions and events in the area. Many thanks to the two of you for this. If we travel to the Côte d'Azur again, we would definitely book here again. A holiday in paradise - the accommodation exceeded our expectations :-)",

On our last night, Julie and her partner made us a little apero and we spent the evening together and told each other stories. It was beautiful and I'm sure we'll visit again. Thank you very much again, you were great! ❤️",
