      comments: 'Coup de cœur pour ce logement, We fell in love with this accommodation, in the charming Fabregas district. Very pleasant shaded terrace. The beaches of La Verne and Fabregas are accessible on foot in a few minutes. Very comfortable accommodation, tastefully renovated. Very friendly hosts. I would not hesitate to come back to Bois Fottés during my next stay in La Seyne sur Mer.',

      comments: "Delight and boundless love! Julie and José Manuel's house in La Seyne-sur-Mer is heaven! Wonderful location: three beautiful beaches within walking distance, great restaurants, a 20-minute walk there is a shop, there are very picturesque views around. The room itself is very cozy and beautiful, Julie built it with her own hands. It looks like a lot of love has gone into it! Large and comfortable bed, shower, kitchen, table in the garden under a tree. And a lot of pleasant little things that say that you are welcome in this house. I am fascinated by the hospitality of Julie and José Manuel! I felt like I was visiting close friends or family members. These are wonderful and bright people who are ready to help at any moment and are very worried that your life in their house goes well. I will definitely visit again! Thank you very much!",
